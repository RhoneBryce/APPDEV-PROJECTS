import React from 'react';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div className="home-page">
            <h1>Welcome to My Home Page</h1>
            <p>
                This is my current home page where I demonstrate React Routing in action.
                By navigating between different routes, you can explore various components
                and see how React handles dynamic content loading and seamless transitions.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
